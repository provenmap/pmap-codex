description: "Explore · WRITE-CAPABLE: Discover the insights and context boards worth showing across the workspace — ranked by the graph, picked by you or chosen for you, authored in parallel, recorded and drawn on the platform"
argument-hint: "[count] [--auto] [--lens reliability,onboarding,ownership] [--board <slug>] [focus]"

The whole workspace, read once over MCP and scored by a script: two ranked menus (insights,
context boards), a ★ set to run as is, agents that author in waves, one paced writer that
records the insights and draws the boards. Read
[`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/discover-authoring/SKILL.md`](../knowledge/discover-authoring/SKILL.md) and
[`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/architect-core/SKILL.md`](../knowledge/architect-core/SKILL.md) first.
**Print every `display` verbatim; branch only on exit codes and named JSON fields.**

## Workflow

1. **Plan** — from the argument: a leading integer → `--count <n>`; `--board <slug>` → the
   subtree to discover in (default the whole tree from `root`); `--lens` passes through; a focus
   prompt → the lenses it matches (say which). Then
   `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --discover [--board <slug>] [--lens <a,b>] [--count <n>]`
   (~1 s per board the first time; cached an hour, `--refresh` re-reads). Exit 1 → print
   `error`, stop (it names the command). Exit 2 → the failure branches below. Print `display`.
2. **Steps 2–7 — read
   `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/discover-authoring/references/discover-workflow.md` NOW and follow
   it exactly; improvise nothing.** Step map: **2 Frame** — one AskUserQuestion (choose for me /
   show the menu; the lens), skipped by `--auto` and wherever no prompt can be answered ·
   **3 Pick** — auto takes the ★ set; the menu is two multi-select questions over the Id column ·
   **4 Briefs** — `--briefs <ids> --rules …` · **5 Author** — waves of ≤4 `insight-author`
   agents (Task), one brief each; inline and sequential when Task is unavailable · **6 Push in
   order** — `--push-insight` / `--push-context-board`, both `--require-pack --push`; exit 3 →
   fix once, else mark failed and continue · **7 Report** — `--report`, verbatim. The pushes
   are journal-free: `create_insight` lands a draft batch and `create_context_board` draws
   outside the tree, so nothing here waits on a commit.

**Outcome:** `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --brief --command discover` → Done · Left · Next, per `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/outcome/SKILL.md`.

## Failure branches

- Script exit 1 with no grant / tools missing → `ProvenMap not configured — run /login (browser) or /configure (manual) first`
- Script exit 2 on a rejected token / MCP 401 → `Your ProvenMap architect token was rejected — run /login to reconnect`
- `create_insight` / `create_context_board` absent → read-only token: the plan and the menu
  still work; recording needs a `read_write` token.
- `notAvailable` on a context-board push → `This ProvenMap server doesn't expose context boards yet — ask your admin to upgrade`; the insights still land.
- Empty root → nothing to discover; offer `/setup-workspace`.
