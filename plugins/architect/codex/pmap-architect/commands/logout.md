Disconnect this machine from ProvenMap: remove the stored login grant
(`~/.provenmap/architect-mcp.json`) and, where scriptable, the host's user-scope MCP server
entry. This is a **local** disconnect — the display explains the server-side caveat.

## Workflow

1. Run the logout mode:

   ```bash
   node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --logout --host codex
   ```

2. Print the JSON `display` field **verbatim in your reply** — never reformat, summarise, or
   rebuild it; the Bash output panel is collapsed for the user. It already covers what was
   removed, the manual `PMAP_MCP_TOKEN` reminder, the server-side revocation step (workspace
   command center → Architect access), and the next command (`/login`).

3. On a non-zero exit, print `display` verbatim and stop.
