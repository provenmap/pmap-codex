Do a playbook, rather than author one. The run loop, which steps belong to a person, and the
proof discipline live in `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/playbook-running/SKILL.md` — read it plus
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/architect-core/SKILL.md` before the first tool call.

**The server decides what is done.** No tool proves a step; a step is finished when
`get_playbook_run` says so, and never because you believe you did the work.
`report_playbook_step` records only what the workspace cannot see: a choice, a skip, a person's
mark, a sign-off the named person gave you. Runs are per person: work yours (`mine` in
`list_playbooks`).

## Workflow

1. **Scope** — `start_playbook` missing from the tools → read-only token: say so, name `/login`
   for a `read_write` token, stop. Resolve the board from `--board`, else the argument, else the
   workspace root. Pass `epicSlug` when the architect named an epic; never ask before starting.
2. **The run** — `list_playbooks` on the board. A live run of yours matching the ask → use it.
   None → match the argument against each playbook's `job`, confirm the playbook by name
   (AskUserQuestion when two fit), then `start_playbook`. Any playbook starts anywhere.
3. **The instructions** — `get_playbook_skill` for that playbook. It is the brief; follow its
   stage order and its per-step tool list. Read it before step 4, never after.
4. **The loop** — `get_playbook_run` for the next available step → do it with that step's tools,
   passing `playbook: { runId, stepId }` on every write → `get_playbook_run` again. Ticked: one
   line naming the step and its evidence, then the next. Not ticked: stop there and say what is
   missing. At a `choice` step ask the person, then `report_playbook_step` `choice` with the
   branch key; nothing behind it opens until it is recorded. A question is yours to answer
   from the board, then `markDone` once the person is satisfied; a sign-off is asked for, then
   recorded with `acknowledge`; a publish is the person's, from **Publish** in ProvenMap.
5. **Stop** — at the end proof, or at the first step that is not yours here: a control with no
   tools, a `code` sub-flow, a `code`-plugin command in the repo. Name where it happens; do not
   work around it.

**Outcome:** `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --brief --command run-playbook --facts '{"playbook":"<slug>","board":"<boardSlug>"}'` → Done · Left · Next, per `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/outcome/SKILL.md`.

## Failure branches

- Tools missing / connection errors → `ProvenMap not configured — run /login (browser) or /configure (manual) first`
- 401 → `Your ProvenMap architect token was rejected — run /login to reconnect`
- 402 on a step's tool → relay it; `report_playbook_step` `skip` if the step is optional, then
  carry on. A required step stops the run there.
- "belongs to …" on a report → the run is a teammate's; start your own.
- Slug not in the catalogue, or disabled → `list_playbooks` says what can be started.
