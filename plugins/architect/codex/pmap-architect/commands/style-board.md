Style one board end-to-end: signals → plan → validate → apply. Methodology and doctrine live in
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/board-styling/SKILL.md` — read it first. All writes are journaled
(working copy), so the architect previews and commits like any board edit.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — pick the target

- Slug argument given → use it.
- No argument → run `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --style-signals --scan` and
  print its `display` verbatim. Offer the least-styled boards (AskUserQuestion, up to 4
  options). Rows with `?` counts mean the server predates the styling read surface — say so and
  let the architect name a board anyway.

### Step 2 — signals

Run `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --style-signals --board <slug>`; print the
`display` verbatim. Note `signalsPath` from the JSON — the validate step needs it.

If the board's elements already show styling (précis `styling` non-null on many elements),
summarize what exists from the applied tokens (e.g. "services are `application`, edges mostly
`synchronous`") and ask (AskUserQuestion): restyle everything, style only unstyled elements, or
stop. Respect the answer for the whole run; when restyling, present current → proposed.

### Step 3 — plan

Author the styling plan per the board-styling skill (composition, semantics, icons — the plan
file shape is in its references/styling-vocabulary.md). Present the plan compactly: the
composition line, sizes table (with reasons), token groups, icon choices (catalog hit or Lucide
fallback per node). Every size carries a one-line reason. Say how many elements were left
untouched because their archetype already speaks for them — that number is a quality signal, not
an omission. Get approval (AskUserQuestion: apply / adjust / stop).

### Step 4 — validate

Write the plan to a temp file. Run
`node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --validate styles --file <plan.json> --against <signalsPath>`.

- Exit 0 → continue (mention warnings, if any, in one line each).
- Exit 3 → fix the reported issues, re-validate. After two failed rounds: stop and say
  `Styling validation keeps failing — the board structure may need work first; run /board <slug> to inspect it.`

### Step 5 — apply, preview, commit

Three batched calls, in order, skipping omitted sections: `apply_composition` →
`apply_semantic_styles` → `apply_icon_shape_styles`. Then architect-core's standard closing move
(preview → title/summary via AskUserQuestion → commit). Report before/after: styled counts from
Step 2 vs the applied plan (nodes sized, tokens applied, composition set). To abandon instead:
`discard_write_session` (warn it reverts the WHOLE working copy).

**Close:** `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --after style-board --facts '{"board":"<slug>"}'` — print verbatim.

## Failure branches

- CLI exit 1 → `ProvenMap not configured — run /login (browser) or /configure (manual) first`
- CLI exit 2 / MCP 401 → `Your ProvenMap architect token was rejected — run /login to reconnect`
- An apply_* call rejects the payload → relay the tool error verbatim, drop that section, continue
  with the rest; name what was skipped in the final report.
- Board not found → likely outside the token's board restriction; re-orient with `get_board_tree`.
