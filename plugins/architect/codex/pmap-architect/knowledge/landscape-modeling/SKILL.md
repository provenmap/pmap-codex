description: How to model an org's digital estate on the ProvenMap root landscape — the inception doctrine, archetype selection, and the binding handoff. Use when bootstrapping an empty workspace (/setup-workspace), placing a new system (/new-app), or editing the root landscape in a /board session. Key capabilities: the modelling doctrine (model what exists, one node per system), the source gate and shallow repo scan (--scan-repos), per-system kinds, app archetypes as the bindability lever, domain-group containers, the L0 granularity budget, the binding-handoff checklist, skill-profiles-start-empty truth, the /setup-workspace interview agendas and plan sketch, the /new-app grill agenda and binding gate. Covers both map mode (model what exists) and found mode (founding landscape for a new product line — strategic-only, graduation path).

# Landscape Modeling

<!-- Distilled from platform's inception mode and archetype seeds:
     services/prompts/modes/inception/inception.prompt.ts (doctrine, workflow,
     approvals posture — rules carried verbatim where quoted),
     seeds/data/archetypes/app-archetypes-seed-data.ts (the app archetype group),
     .docs/core-concepts/board-tree.md (app-nesting rule),
     .docs/getting-started/quick-start.md. One deliberate divergence is
     documented at the bottom. -->

## The doctrine (inception rules, carried verbatim)

- **Model what EXISTS, not what could.** A small honest landscape beats an aspirational one.
- **One node per system.**
- Only a node with a real repository gets an app board. A system with no repo is just a node on
  the landscape.
- **Never draw inside a bound app board.** Its nodes, edges and aspects arrive from the
  developer's first push; anything you draw there is a claim the plugin would have to reconcile
  against reality.
- If the architect is vague about a system, **ask — never invent a service to fill out the
  diagram**.
- **Estate facts come from the architect, never from ambient exploration.** Never touch the
  filesystem, git state, or any repository unprompted — no listing directories "to get
  oriented". Scanning is a gated offer (the source gate below): only via `--scan-repos`, only
  on architect-given paths. Scan output is interview *candidates* the architect confirms,
  renames, or drops — never conclusions.
- The interview is *a few short questions, not a form* — stop as soon as you can name the apps.
  Do not interrogate.

## The source gate and the shallow scan (map mode)

Before any estate question, ask how the architect wants to convey the estate
(AskUserQuestion, multi-select — mixing is normal): **describe in conversation** · **scan
repo folders** (they name the paths) · **share documents** (read in-session). Record the
choice — and any scan inventory — in the drafts file (architect-core): a resumed interview
neither re-asks the gate nor re-scans. Found mode skips the gate (nothing exists to scan);
a real repo named mid-interview may still get the scan offer (per-answer fork, below).

The scan is shallow by design — identity facts only, depth 1, never recursive:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --scan-repos --paths <p1,p2,...>
```

Each candidate carries `{path, dirName, isGitRepo, gitRemote, manifestKind, manifestName,
readmeTitle, monorepoHint}`; the result carries `skipped[]` and `truncated` (the 200-entry
cap is always reported — relay it, never hide it). Deep analysis stays the code plugin's job
after binding. Your job on the output is judgment: dedupe, propose system names, kinds, and
repo scopes, and feed the confirmation table — scan output never bypasses the interview.

## Archetype selection — the bindability lever

Call `get_archetypes` first; never guess names. Archetype choice is **how a node becomes
app-bindable**: the app-group archetypes carry the catalogue type the platform derives the
repo's scope from (`create_nodes` has no separate field for it).

Every named system gets an explicit **kind** — nothing defaults to repo-backed; batch ONE
follow-up question for systems the architect didn't classify:

| Kind | Archetype | App board? |
|---|---|---|
| `repo` — existing, own repository | app archetype matching the repo scope | yes — binds `existing_app` |
| `new-app` — being built now, will have its own repository | app archetype matching the repo scope | yes — binds `new_app` |
| `no-repo` — existing, no repository | system archetype | no — just a node |
| `SaaS` — third-party integration | external-integration archetype | no |
| `planned` — decided, nobody building it yet | system archetype + graduation-path narration | no — graduates via `/new-app` |

**The lever between `new-app` and `planned` is "will it have its own repository", NOT "does its
code exist yet".** A system being built right now is `new-app`: it gets an app archetype, a
board, and a `new_app` binding that waits on the first push — that is what routes it into build
prep. Only a system nobody is building yet is `planned`. Ask that question directly for anything
not yet real; the two kinds are the interview's mirror of the server's two observation types.

**While you have them answering: ownership.** An archetype declares a field contract, and the
half of it nobody else can supply — `owner`, `stage`, `status`, `criticality` — is exactly what an
architect knows and a codebase never will. When you are already batching the kind question, add
owner and stage for the systems being placed, and write them onto each node's `attributes` map in
the same `create_nodes` call. Two or three evidenced fields, not a questionnaire, and never a
guess — an invented owner is worse than an empty cell. Contract, tiers and merge semantics:
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/board-reading/references/archetype-attributes.md`.

- **Repo-backed systems** (`repo` and `new-app` alike) get an app archetype matching the repo's
  scope: `web-app`,
  `backend-app`, `mono-repo`, `microservice-app`, `mobile-app`, `desktop-app`, `device-app`,
  `worker-app`, `gateway-app`, `integration-app`, `library-app`, `function-app`, `infra-app`,
  `data-app`, `agent-app`, `custom-app`.
- **Repo-less systems** get a system archetype from the catalogue (generic system, service,
  frontend app); SaaS and third parties get the external-integration archetype; people and
  user types get the actor archetype.
- **Grouping containers** come from the domain-group family (security zone, data platform,
  external integrations, infrastructure group, messaging group, …) — use them only where
  the org's zones are real. A zone is real when its members relate to each other more than
  to the rest of the estate; a box drawn around systems that never touch is a label, and it
  makes the landscape read as arbitrary. On an existing board, stop guessing and measure:
  `pmap-architect.js --group-plan --board <slug>` reports each zone's cohesion, the elements
  that belong at root level (cross-cutting or boundary), zones that have outgrown one board,
  and the drift from the current containment. A zone you keep for a non-topological reason
  (vendor cohort, compliance boundary, org chart) is legitimate — start its description with
  `Grouping rationale:` so the record carries the reason and the gate stands down.
  The server still enforces only "parent must be a container"; the structural gates
  (`--validate diagram`) now also refuse an edge between a node and its own container.

## Drawing the landscape

Root board only. Order per the diagram contract (board-reading): containers first → nodes (ONE
`create_nodes` call) → edges (ONE `create_edges` call — an edge wherever two systems actually
connect: sync calls, async messages, data flows, dependencies). **L0 budget: 10–30 nodes** —
shared platforms worth showing, not every server. Pre-flight the payload before any write:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --validate diagram --file <payload.json> [--known-slugs <existing,slugs>]
```

Confirmation posture (the platform's own): present the plan as a table (system, kind,
archetype, container, repo/scope), get **one** conversational go-ahead, then proceed through the batch without
re-asking per call. The whole scaffold gathers in the working copy, so walking away mid-setup
is recoverable — but discard reverts the WHOLE session (app-made changes included): confirm
with the named boards + counts first (architect-core).

## App boards and the nesting rule

`create_board(ownerNodeSlug, newBoardSlug, name)` per repo-backed node — it creates the board
AND points the landscape node at it as its drill-down. The board is born **EMPTY**. Over MCP,
`create_board` works for **root-board nodes only**. Repo-backed means `repo` **and `new-app`**
alike: a repository that does not exist yet still gets its board, and the content arrives from
the developer's first push.

**App-nesting rule:** a governing repo can never bind to a board with an app board anywhere
above or below it. So repo-backed slots live on the root landscape; a layer under an app board
is permanently a plain layer; and "extract this component into its own service" means a new
landscape node + board (+ re-wiring intents), never bind-in-place. Relay the server's refusal
verbatim if it fires.

## Completing the binding — `convert_node_to_app`

A repo-backed slot completes **in-session**: `convert_node_to_app {nodeSlug, branch, observationType}` turns a
root-landscape node into an app in one act — ensures its layer board, registers the
code-plugin source, binds it GOVERNING on the branch. Rules:

- The node's **archetype must be app-bindable** (an app archetype — that's what sets the repo
  scope). A generic-system node refuses; fix the archetype first.
- **`observationType` is required** — the architect's observation, recorded on the binding. In an
  interview it **follows the kind, with no re-asking**: `'existing_app'` for a `repo` slot (the
  code already exists), `'new_app'` for a `new-app` slot (net-new and still being built — a
  freshly created empty repo, or one not created yet, is still `'new_app'`). Found-mode
  graduations and extractions are `'new_app'` too. Only outside an interview, where no kind was
  captured, is it genuinely ambiguous → ask at the gate: _new app still needing implementation
  planning_ vs _existing app now being connected_. A `'new_app'` conversion routes into
  **build prep** next (the app-readiness
  workflow): prep now in-session when it is the run's lone graduation, else name
  `/prepare-app <board>` per app — the attention queue keeps it listed until prepped.
- **Pre-check eligibility** with `--classify-tree` (bind-eligibility column) before offering
  it; if the server still refuses (app-nesting rule), relay the refusal verbatim.
- **Credentials are never issued here** — the tool deliberately returns none. The developer
  connects the repository with the code plugin (`/login` + `/configure` against the layer
  board) and makes the first push.
- Advisory documents attach with `bind_reference_source {workBoardSlug, title, type, url|content}`
  — a reference binding, exempt from the nesting rule, and enough to author intents.

## The handoff checklist

Whether bindings were completed in-session or deferred, close the scaffold with the
deterministic checklist (converted nodes become confirmations; deferred repos become the
developer to-do):

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --render-scaffold --file <scaffold.json>
```

The scaffold JSON: `{ workspaceName?, boards[{slug,name,ownerNodeSlug}],
reposToBind[{repo,boardSlug,role,branch}], notes[] }`. Print the output verbatim. One truth it
carries that must never be softened: **skill profiles start EMPTY** — nothing is auto-seeded
by binding; skills are composed in the platform's skill storefront afterwards. (The platform's
own inception prompt claims a recipe seeds the profile — that is drift; do not repeat it.)

## /setup-workspace: the interview agendas, the plan sketch, the spine banner

The fork at the top of the interview (map or found) picks one of two agendas. Both are *a few
short questions, not a form* (the doctrine above), and both open with the one-line answer that
becomes the root board description (`apply_diagram_info`).

**Map mode — the org interview:** what the org does (one line); the systems that exist today,
each with an explicit **kind** (the table above — nothing defaults to repo-backed, and the
unclassified are batched into ONE follow-up question); the infra worth showing at L0; actors and
user types; the real zones worth grouping.

**Found mode — the product-line interview:** what is being built and for whom (one line); the
intended systems and what each owns; actors and user types; the external SaaS it will lean on;
the real zones. Stop when the intended systems have names, and never invent beyond what the
architect has decided (the founding-landscape divergence below).

**The plan sketch.** Present the scaffold plan as a fenced ASCII sketch of the landscape first —
containers as boxes, the systems inside them with their kind chips, arrows for the main edges,
with the L0 budget keeping it readable — then the confirmation table (system, kind, archetype,
container, repo/scope). In found mode the table's kind column reads `planned`. One go-ahead
covers the whole batch (the confirmation posture above).

**Resuming, and closing the window.** The scaffold drafts file (architect-core) records the
chosen mode: a *continue*-mode run on a sparse, still-unbound root extends what exists rather
than restarting, and re-asks the fork only when there is no drafts file. Once the root is
populated or anything is bound, `/setup-workspace`'s window has closed — after the first repo
binds, systems are added one at a time through `/new-app`.

**The spine banner.** `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-architect.js --spine setup-workspace
--step <n>` renders each step change; `<n>` is the step number (3.5 for the styling step). Add
`--interview-mode map|found` once the fork is answered, and `--banked '<json>'` with a flat JSON
object of the name/value facts captured so far. Print the result verbatim in place of the
`**Step N/M — <name>**` banner — never reformat, reorder, or summarise.

## /new-app: the grill agenda, the L1 sketch, the binding gate

**The grill agenda** — bounded rounds, worked before any write; ask, never invent:

1. **Purpose** — one sentence.
2. **Placement** — where it sits on the landscape: read the root board's nodes and edges, then
   propose its neighbours for the architect to confirm.
3. **Archetype** — an **app archetype** matching its repo scope if it will have a repo (the
   bindability lever above), else a system archetype.
4. **What it owns** — data, endpoints, events. This is the L1 skeleton.
5. **What it replaces or splits** — the existing nodes that need re-wiring.

Keep the running plan in a drafts file (architect-core) so the pass is resumable.

**The L1 sketch — a deliberate divergence.** The wizard's "never draw inside an app board"
guards scaffold handoffs, where developer pushes supply the truth. `/new-app` is different: the
system is being *planned*, there is no code yet, and the architect's target sketch is the
point. Drawing the L1 skeleton there is deliberate: containers, the key components, and the
edges the grill named — nothing invented to fill the diagram. Narrate the reconciliation truth:
when the repo binds and pushes, analysis reconciles against the sketch, and intents appear
where reality disagrees.

**The binding gate** closes in-session, without a portal trip. Three outcomes:

- **The system has a repo** → offer `convert_node_to_app {nodeSlug, branch, observationType}`
  under the rules above — `'new_app'` for the system being planned here (a freshly created
  empty repo is still `'new_app'`), `'existing_app'` only when the grill revealed the code
  already exists. Credentials are never issued here; the developer connects the repository
  separately with the code plugin.
- **The planning material is a document** → `bind_reference_source` on the new board — a
  reference binding is enough to author intents against.
- **The architect defers** → the classic narration: _"Intents need a code-bound board — bind
  the repo, then rerun `/author-intent <board>` and I'll land this draft."_

## Deliberate divergence: the founding landscape (found mode)

`/setup-workspace` runs in one of two modes, forked at the top of the interview:

- **Map mode** (default): the estate exists. Every inception rule above applies unchanged —
  model what EXISTS, never invent a system.
- **Found mode**: a product line being conceived from scratch. Nothing exists yet, so "model
  what exists" would model nothing. The divergence: a **founding landscape** models what
  SHOULD exist — the intended systems as root nodes with **system archetypes** (never app
  archetypes), real zones as containers, **no app boards, no bindings**. The rule becomes:
  **never invent beyond what the architect has decided** — grill, don't fabricate; every node
  traces to an interview answer.

Narrate the truth every time: *"this is target state — systems graduate as they become real."*

**Graduation path** (the standing next step of every founding scaffold): when a system becomes
real → `/new-app`-style pass on its node — fix the archetype to an **app archetype** (that's
the bindability lever above) → `create_board` →
`convert_node_to_app {nodeSlug, branch, observationType: 'new_app'}` → L1 sketch + founding
intent. Mixed estates work naturally: the fork is per-answer, not
exclusive — a real system named during a found-mode interview is drawn as in map mode, and a
**planned** system named during a map-mode interview gets found-mode treatment: system
archetype, no board, graduation path narrated. That treatment is for `planned` only: a
**`new-app`** system named during a map-mode interview is repo-backed and binds in-session as
`new_app` — do not route a system someone is actively building down the graduation path.
