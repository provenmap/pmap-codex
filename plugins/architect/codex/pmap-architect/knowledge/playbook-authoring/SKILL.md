description: How to author a ProvenMap playbook — an org-level guided track for one job, composed from steps the platform already watches. Use when the architect wants to turn a job ("replace the stale doc", "run our ADR process", "onboard a new team to the map") into a playbook others in the org can start, or wants one like an existing playbook with changes. Key capabilities: the authoring interview (job → overlap/template → shape → human-only parameters → read-back → draft), composition rules (building blocks, stages, dependencies, the end proof), the step-kind and fact catalogue, the draft_playbook landing and its issue loop.

# Playbook Authoring

<!-- Distilled from the platform's playbook schemas (playbook.zod.ts,
     playbook-step.schema.ts, playbook-fact.schema.ts, playbook-validate.ts) and its
     playbook seeds. Keep field names and limits aligned with those when updating. -->

## What a playbook is

A playbook names **one job** and the steps that finish it, grouped into named **stages**. Each
step points at a door the product already has (a plugin command, a chat prompt, an on-screen
control, a work item, a publish), and the server marks the step done by **watching real workspace
state**. The server itself executes nothing: it observes. A person follows the playbook in the
guide, or an agent host runs it from the terminal (`/run-playbook`, playbook-running) — either
way the proof is the same state, watched the same way.

Authors **pick** what proves a step done from a closed fact vocabulary; they never write a
predicate. Playbooks live at the **org** level beside archetypes and insight skills. Anyone who
can edit a board can start a listed, enabled playbook on it. Authoring needs the org's plan to
include `playbook.author`.

## The tools

| Tool                  | Use                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_playbooks`      | the listed, enabled catalogue (slug, name, summary, `job`, door, target kind) + this workspace's runs                |
| `get_playbook`        | one full definition (stages, steps, end proof), building blocks and disabled rows included — the template source     |
| `list_insight_skills` | the org's insight skills (slug, name) — the only valid `skill` values for an `insight-run` step                      |
| `draft_playbook`      | save a NEW playbook, **disabled**; returns issues unsaved, or `{ saved: true, slug }` plus a top-level `composerUrl` |
| `start_playbook`      | start an existing playbook on a board (when the overlap check finds the job is already covered)                      |
| `get_playbook_skill`  | a playbook compiled to one runnable file — what `/run-playbook` follows; read it to see how a step reads to an agent |

`draft_playbook` writes the org's catalogue directly. It is **not** part of the working copy:
there is nothing to preview or commit, and `get_write_session` never shows it. It refuses a slug
that already exists; changing an existing playbook stays in the composer.

## The authoring interview

Keep the draft in `~/.provenmap/architect/drafts/playbook-<slug>.json` (the definition as it
stands, plus `"phase"`) and update it after every answer, so the interview survives context
loss. Delete it once the draft is saved or abandoned.

### 1. The job

One question, unless the command argument already answers it: **"What should someone have
finished when they reach the end?"** From the answer, derive and show in one block:

- `name` (≤100) — the job as a title: "Run a security review before release".
- `summary` (≤200) — one line for the chooser: what the person ends up with.
- `job` (≤300) — one sentence in the user's own words, first person or imperative. Chat and
  `/start` match open-ended asks against it, so write it the way someone would ask.
- `slug` — kebab-case, from the name.
- `door` — `understand` (make sense of a system) · `author` (decide or specify change) ·
  `operate` (keep the map and the work moving) · `share` (show it to others). `setup` is the
  setup guide's own; do not use it.
- `targetKind` — what a run is about: `appBoard` (one app, the usual case) · `workspace`
  (the whole landscape) · `epic` (a body of work items). It decides what "Start" asks for and
  which board the facts read by default.
- `icon` — `{ "kind": "lucide", "name": "<kebab-case lucide icon>" }`; default `route`.

Correct and confirm once; do not grill fields the user did not care about.

### 2. Overlap and template

`list_playbooks`. If a playbook's `job` already covers the ask, AskUserQuestion: **Start
`<slug>`** (→ `start_playbook` on a board they name, then stop) · **Start from `<slug>`** (use
it as a template) · **Write a new one**. When the user names an existing playbook to start from
("like the migration one, plus a security review"), go straight to the template path.

Template path: `get_playbook` → take its `definition`, give it the new `slug`, `name`,
`summary` and `job`, then run step 3 as an edit of that shape rather than from scratch. Say
which seed or fork it came from in the read-back.

### 3. Shape — propose, don't interrogate

Propose the whole playbook as one table, then refine it with the user. Columns: stage · step
id · summary · kind · what proves it done. Compose from
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/playbook-authoring/references/step-catalogue.md` (read it now):

- **Stages** — 2–5 named phases in reading order (≤12). The guide groups by them and the
  composer draws them as columns. Name them for the reader ("Set up", "Understand", "Decide",
  "Share"), key them kebab-case.
- **One step, one action at one door.** `summary` ≤120, phrased as the action. Split a step
  that asks for two things.
- **Reuse the building blocks** as `playbook` steps rather than restating them:
  `connect-and-sync` when the job needs the app's code on the board (bind the repo, first
  push), `publish-and-share` when the job ends in a shared link. `map-with-architect`,
  `map-with-chat` and `first-app` belong to the setup guide; don't nest them.
- **Observed over ticked.** Prefer a step the server can see (a sync, a context board, an
  work item, a publish). An `acknowledge` step is a person's tick; use it only for what happens
  outside the product (a review meeting, a sign-off). At most 3.
- **Dependencies.** A step lists in `dependsOn` the steps whose output it needs. Steps in a
  later stage usually depend on the previous stage's steps; steps in one stage run side by side
  unless one needs another. No cycles.
- **Tools, when an agent will run it.** Every step kind implies the tools an agent calls for
  it (a context-board step implies `create_context_board` and the drawing tools; a work item step
  implies `create_work_item` and `transition_work_item`; a step a person does in the browser implies
  none), and the compiled skill prints the implied list. Name `tools` only when a step needs
  something specific (`[{ "name": "create_board", "instruction": "…" }]`, wire names as MCP
  advertises them, at most 8). An authored list on a step the run proves through what it
  produces must still include the tool that creates that thing (`create_context_board`,
  `create_work_item`, `create_epic`, `create_insight`), or the composer refuses it: an agent could
  do the work and the step would never tick. Never guess a tool name: the server refuses a
  save naming a tool the workspace does not expose.
- **The end proof.** `endProof` names the step whose completion ends the run, and it must be
  a proof: a `publish` step, an `acknowledge` step, a `playbook` step, a `work-item` step with
  `until: "confirmed"`, or a `command`/`control` step whose fact is `board.published` or
  `workItem.confirmed`. A confirmed work item is proven only
  when a later push verifies it, so a run ending there can wait a long time; prefer a publish
  or an acknowledge unless delivery is the point of the playbook.

### 4. What only a person can decide

Ask (AskUserQuestion, a few options each, your recommendation first) only for parameters that
change what the playbook means, and batch them into as few questions as possible:

- `insight-run` → which skill: offer slugs from `list_insight_skills`, never invent one.
- `acknowledge` → who confirms (`role`, e.g. "engineering lead") and what they confirm (`text`).
- `work-item` → the work item `type` and whether the step ends at hand-off or at confirmed.
- `publish` → which board: the run's target, the root, or the board a `context-board` or
  chat-starter step drew (`{ "kind": "step", "stepId": … }`).
- `choice` → the question and 2–4 branches, each running a playbook slug or nothing.

Write chat-starter prompts, context-board questions and guidance text yourself; they show in
the read-back, where the user can change them.

### 5. Read-back gate

Render the assembled playbook once: the job block, then one table per stage (step · what the
person does · what proves it done · depends on), then the end proof. AskUserQuestion:
**Draft it** · **Revise**. Revise loops back to the part named; never draft without this gate.

### 6. Land

`draft_playbook` with the full definition (`slug`, `name`, `summary`, `icon`, `description`,
`job`, `targetKind`, `door`, `stages`, `steps`, `endProof`; `listed` defaults to true).

- `saved: false` with `issues` → fix each issue named (the messages cite step ids) and call
  again. Never resend an unchanged definition. Two failed rounds → show the issues and ask.
- A schema error (a missing or mistyped field) → fix the field the error names and resend.
- A plan denial (402, `playbook.author`) → stop: the org's plan does not include playbook
  authoring. Relay the denial's message, keep the drafts file, and name the fix: a plan that
  includes it, changed by an org admin.
- Saved → print `↗ Open in the composer: <composerUrl>` (skip the line when it is null) and
  say plainly: the playbook is saved **disabled**. Nobody can start it until someone previews
  it in the composer and enables it.

## Read-only token

`draft_playbook` absent from the tool list means a `read` token. Say so before the interview,
name the fix (a `read_write` token from `/login`), and do not run the interview: the composer
has no import, so a draft that cannot land is lost work.
