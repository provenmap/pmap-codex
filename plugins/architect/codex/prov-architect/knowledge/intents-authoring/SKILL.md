# Intents Authoring

<!-- Distilled from platform services/prompts/base/facet-prompt-fragments.ts
     (buildIntentsFragment) — the platform vocabulary below is carried verbatim
     where quoted — plus the create_intent input contract
     (workboard-intents/nodes/intent-tool.types.ts). -->

## What an intent is

An intent is a **living spec**: what the org wants and why, anchored to the elements it
concerns, and **only code changes make it true**. There is no separate spec entity upstream of
it — the intent carries the demand AND the delivery record, so the why never freezes in a
document nobody re-reads while the code moves on.

Two halves, both required for it to be worth reading in six months:

- **The why** — the `narrative` (the problem, the goal, what is explicitly out of scope; markdown,
  up to 8000 chars), backed by the per-anchor notes. This is what a reviewer needs when they ask
  "can we defend this decision?" It is **optional** — see the judgement call below.
- **The what** — the `directive`, naming each element by slug with the end state it must reach.
  This is what a developer implements and what a later push is checked against.

**Three prose fields, three readers — do not collapse them.** `description` (≤500) is the one-line
subtitle the queue shows; `narrative` (≤8000) is the durable why; `directive` (≤4000) is the
instruction. Putting the rationale in the directive buries the instruction and blows its cap;
putting it in the description truncates it.

**When to write a narrative.** Write one when the material carries reasoning that would otherwise
be lost: a PRD or RFC's problem statement, a rejected alternative, an explicit out-of-scope
boundary, a constraint that explains an odd-looking choice. Do NOT manufacture one — an intent
whose why is genuinely "the finding says so, and the finding is linked" should omit the field
rather than restate its own directive in longer words. Padding it is worse than leaving it empty:
it trains the architect to skip the section on every future intent.

## Lifecycle

`draft → open (architect locks it; developers can now pull it) → assigned → in_progress →
implemented | rejected | resolved_other`

- `needs_clarification` is a detour, not an end: a developer bounces an intent back when code
  reality no longer matches it. The architect revises and re-opens it (`needs_clarification →
  open`) or rejects it.
- **You author DRAFTS only** — a human locks a draft open. Every write joins the working copy
  and awaits review (passive review); narrate the created draft by slug, never pre-confirm.
- `stale` means the code facts under an intent's anchors drifted since it was written — it needs
  the architect's re-review, so say so rather than treating it as current.
- `implemented` is the developer's CLAIM; `verifiedAt` is the server's PROOF that a later push
  actually matches. Do not present a claim as proven.
- Rejecting an intent automatically reverts any board changes it staged. Deleting an intent
  withdraws everything it staged (only `draft`/`open`/`needs_clarification` can be deleted —
  terminal intents are the delivery ledger).

## The tools

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `list_intents` | summaries; `scope: 'tree'` spans layer boards |
| `get_intent` | full detail: directive, anchors + notes, origin, resolution history, staleness |
| `create_intent` | author a draft (incl. the `narrative` and, for a bound document, `draftedFromSourceSlug`) |
| `update_intent` | revise a draft/needs_clarification intent — fields + context anchors (changed anchors preserved) |
| `transition_intent` | lifecycle moves (draft→open locks for developer pulls; →rejected reverts staged changes) |
| `assign_intent` | assign to users; empty list clears; assigning an open intent moves it to assigned |
| `promote_insight_findings` | reviewed findings/suggestions → one draft intent each (see insights-review) |
| `delete_intent` | delete + withdraw everything staged |

Address intents by slug (`list_intents` → `get_intent`).

## Authoring a good intent

`create_intent` takes `{ workBoardSlug, name, directive (10–4000 chars), description?,
narrative?, draftedFromSourceSlug?, anchors[]{elementType, aspectKind?, slug, note?}, priority?,
effort? }`.

**Provenance — `draftedFromSourceSlug`.** When the material was a **bound document** (a PRD, an
RFC, an ADR), pass the catalog source's slug. The intent then carries a *Drafted from* line
pointing at that document, so the org's version and the board's version are visibly the same
thing. Get slugs from `list_source_bindings` (the `sourceSlug` column). An unknown slug is
**rejected** — the create fails rather than silently dropping the link, so read the bindings
first rather than guessing a slug from the document's title. Omit it entirely when the material
came from the conversation, a pasted file, or the architect's own description: this records where
a draft *came from*, not what it is about.

**Anchors.** Anchor a new intent to what it is about: board elements (node/edge), an aspect row
(a table, an endpoint — pass `aspectKind`), or a child layer board. Add a note per anchor saying
why it is there; **the implementer reads it**. Anchors you author carry the `context` role
('changed' anchors come only from captures that physically edited elements).

**Structured directives.** Write the directive so a concrete diff could be derived from it:

- Name every element **by slug**, exactly.
- One change per intent — split unrelated changes.
- State the operation explicitly: **add / modify / remove**, with the target and the desired end
  state.
- For a graph-shaped change, prefer making the actual board edit (diagram write tools — the
  concrete diff mints its own `board_diff` intent when the session commits) over describing
  the change in prose.

## The authoring loop — impact → attach → describe

Attaching elements and describing *why each is attached* is the platform's most important
authoring feature — do it natively, never as an afterthought. The loop (route first per
architect-core's taxonomy — intents are legal only on code-bound boards):

1. **Seed.** The elements named by the architect, the material they brought (prose, a shared
   file, a bound document), or a board edit sitting in the working copy.
2. **Sweep candidates** — facts from reads, ranking from judgment: spine radius
   (`get_edges` with `nodeSlugs` on the seeds; one more hop only for hubs; classify
   inbound/outbound); aspect fan-out (`get_node_aspects` on seeds + implicated neighbours —
   the pages, endpoints, tables, channels, authz entries the change actually touches);
   affected child layers (`layerBoardSlug` ⇒ layer anchors). **Candidates on other boards
   become separate per-board intents** — group by home board; an intent is single-board
   (cross-board anchors are inert).
3. **Collision check.** `list_intents` on each target board — existing open intents sharing
   anchor slugs are flagged (conflicting intents are withheld from developer pulls); the
   architect decides merge / supersede / proceed.
4. **Propose.** Ranked table per board (≤15 rows, "+N more"): slug, type (+aspectKind),
   one-line *why affected*. AskUserQuestion multiSelect — the architect prunes and adds.
5. **Describe — the recording session, spoken.** Per attached anchor, ask the platform's own
   question with the platform's verbs (*change / add / fix / remove / investigate*) and compose
   the note exactly as the web Intent Editor does — `"Change: collect the new consent field
   before submit"`. Templates and composition rules:
   [references/anchor-recording.md](references/anchor-recording.md). Batch a few per round;
   skipping is fine (the anchor attaches noteless).
6. **Grill the gaps.** When the material is thin — no why, no done-bar, no named elements —
   run a round or two from [references/authoring-interview.md](references/authoring-interview.md):
   2–4 questions chosen by what the material *lacks*, never the whole bank as a form. This is
   what `/author-intent` runs long-form.
7. **Land.** Assemble the directive per the structured rules below, grouped by verb the way
   the editor's `composeDirective` does. Pre-flight with
   `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/prov-architect.js --validate intent --file <payload.json>`.
   Multi-board ⇒ the `create_intent` calls share the one working copy automatically; report
   each created draft by slug.

**Enrichment and revision — `update_intent`.** An already-minted `draft` or
`needs_clarification` intent is revised in place: name, directive, description, narrative,
priority, effort, and its **context anchors** (replace-all — capture-owned `changed` anchors and the
staged board diff are preserved; withdrawing staging stays an explicit act via `delete_intent`
or transition→rejected). Null/omitted fields stay unchanged; origin is immutable; changing
anchors re-baselines the intent and clears staleness. **The bounced-intent loop is now real:**
`needs_clarification` → read the developer's question (`get_intent`), revise via
`update_intent`, then re-open with `transition_intent`. Locked (open/assigned/in_progress/
terminal) intents refuse edits — relay that.

## Concrete board changes vs directive intents

Two channels, both reviewed:

1. **Directive intent** (`create_intent`) — work for a developer to implement in code.
2. **Direct board edit** (diagram write tools) — the architect's own change to the diagram;
   on a governed board it stages and mints a `board_diff` intent automatically.

Pick by where the truth changes: code change wanted → directive intent; diagram change wanted →
board edit.
