Works from a cold start. In a repo `/analyze` built, `--pull` reads the local board (never mirrors over it) and refuses until `/sync` has pushed it. Print every `display` verbatim; branch only on exit codes and named fields. `--board <slug>` adds `--board-slug <slug>` to both `pmap-ground.js` calls; else the CLI uses the configured `boardSlug`.

**0 Preflight** — `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-preflight.js`; the gate is the script's, not yours. 0 → go (`repairs.boardsRecovered` non-empty = state just restored from the server, per its `display`); 1 (not connected / credentials rejected) → **connect-now offer**; 2 (binding unverified) → print `error`, stop, name `/status`; 11 branch mismatch → AskUserQuestion per the branch-mismatch prompt in `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/provenmap-integration/SKILL.md`.

**1 Pull & inventory** — `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-ground.js --pull --host codex`. Exit 0 → board mirrored to `.provenmap/boards/<boardSlug>.json` (or read from it), corpus inventoried, and after a re-bind the previous board's links carried into this store — print `display`. **Quiet run:** `evidence.drifted`, `evidence.missing` and `evidence.unlinkedNodes` all empty → say so in one line, skip Steps 2–4, go to the Outcome. Else carry the JSON's `evidence` and `context` into Step 2.

**2 Propose evidence links** — **read `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/grounding/SKILL.md` NOW and follow it exactly; improvise nothing.** It owns the substantiation bar, anchor/excerpt discipline, drift handling, and how `evidence`/`context` become the link set you write to `.provenmap/evidence-links.json`.

**3 Push** — `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-ground.js --push --links .provenmap/evidence-links.json --host codex`.

**4 Report** — on exit 0 print the push `display` verbatim: it already states stored/removed/drifted counts, unresolved slugs, re-drifted documents, and the next command. Then add Step 2's unlinked-node findings.

**`pmap-ground.js` exits** — 0 success. 1 config error → **connect-now offer**; a **branch mismatch**, a **missing board slug**, an **unpushed analysis** (`/sync` first) and (on `--push`) a **missing/unreadable `--links` file** also exit 1 — there relay `error` verbatim and stop; it names its own fix. 3 (`--push` only) links-file validation error → repair per the grounding skill, retry once, then stop and report `validationErrors[]` verbatim. 4 API error (board fetch or push rejected) — `errorType: "auth_invalid"` → **connect-now offer**; otherwise relay `error` verbatim, stop, name `/ground` as the retry.

**Outcome:** `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-status.js --brief --command ground` → Done · Left · Next, per `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/outcome/SKILL.md`.

## Connect-now offer

Trigger: not configured, or `errorType: "auth_invalid"`. AskUserQuestion "Connect to ProvenMap now?":

- **Connect now** → browser login: each `display` **in your reply**: `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --start`, then `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --poll --host codex --domain code` (timeout ~250s). `complete` → resume the failed step; else stop (display explains).
- **Not now** → stop: "ProvenMap not configured — run `/login` (browser) or `/configure` (manual) first" (rejected: "Your ProvenMap credentials were rejected — run `/login` to reconnect").
