**Print every `display` verbatim** in your reply — never reformat, reorder, or summarise; branch only on exit codes and named fields.

**Modes** — from the command argument: `--board <slug>` = that board; `--all` = every in-scope board; none = the only board, else list them and ask which.

**0 Preflight** — `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-preflight.js`: 0 → go (`repairs.boardsRecovered` non-empty = state just restored from the server, per its `display`); 1 (not connected / credentials rejected) → **connect-now offer**; 2 (binding unverified) → print `error`, stop, name `/status`; 11 branch mismatch → AskUserQuestion per the branch-mismatch prompt in `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/provenmap-integration/SKILL.md`.

**1 Config** — read `.provenmap/config.json` (`boardSlug`, `branch`, `baseUrl`, credentials); missing, or no `boardSlug` → **connect-now offer**. **2 Manifest** — read `.provenmap/boards/manifest.json` (the boards and their `layer`); missing → stop, name `/analyze`.

**Steps 2.5–6 — read `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/claude-code-plugin-sync/references/sync-workflow.md` NOW and follow it exactly; improvise nothing.** It holds every call, flag, branch, prompt, and rule: **2.5** binding-scope check — the **user** chooses archive / delete / skip; only in-scope boards sync · **3** pick the mode's boards · **3.5** board URLs + orphaned child boards · **3.8** integrity gate (`pmap-prepass.js --validate`) — **exit 3 stops the sync: push nothing** · **4** push ascending by `layer`, ≤3 concurrent per layer (`pmap-sync.js`; `--no-verify` skips the read-back, discouraged) · **5** parse the CLI JSON — always surface `conflicts`, `deletedOnServer`, `verify`, `replaceFullPayload` · **6** report each board, then coverage, styling, orphaned boards.

**`pmap-sync.js` exits** — 0 success. 1 config error → **connect-now offer**; a **branch mismatch** and an **out-of-scope board** also exit 1 — there relay `error` verbatim (it names the fix; config is fine, so no connect-now), and offer Step 2.5's cleanup for out-of-scope. 2 analysis file error → name `/analyze`. 3 validation error → relay `error` verbatim. 4 API error → relay `error` verbatim; the CLI already retries transient failures and maps HTTP errors — don't re-derive them. `errorType: "auth_invalid"` → **connect-now offer**. `errorType: "forbidden"` → surface the server's message verbatim, never offer re-login; repair per the reference's *inconsistent board tree* section.

## Connect-now offer

Used whenever ProvenMap is not configured or the credentials were rejected (`errorType: "auth_invalid"`). Ask with **AskUserQuestion** — "Connect to ProvenMap now?" (**Connect now** / **Not now**):

- **Connect now** → run the browser login here, printing each JSON `display` verbatim **in your reply** (the Bash output panel is collapsed for the user): `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --start`, then `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --poll --host codex --domain code` (generous Bash timeout, e.g. 250s). On `status: "complete"`, resume this command from the step that failed; anything else — stop, the display explains.
- **Not now** → stop with the canonical message: "ProvenMap not configured — run `/login` (browser) or `/configure` (manual) first" (or, when credentials were rejected: "Your ProvenMap credentials were rejected — run `/login` to reconnect").
