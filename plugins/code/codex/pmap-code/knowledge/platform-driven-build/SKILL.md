# Platform-Driven Build — Methodology

`/build` invokes this skill to implement the platform's spec in the repo. The spec has up to four sources, **by primacy**:

| Source | Carries | Comes from |
|---|---|---|
| **Compiled skills** (primary) | Specs, guidelines, conventions, stack choices | `/skills` sync → `skills.skillsDir` (lock-managed files) |
| Intents | Explicit architect work items with anchors | `pmap-intents.js` (pack `intents.open[]`) |
| Board design | Components + relationships (unbuilt elements) | pack `design.unbuilt[]` |
| Aspect snapshots | Data & API contracts | `.provenmap/build/aspects.json` |

Most builds are **skills-driven**: no pre-designed board exists, and the board is *created* by `/analyze` + `/sync` after building. Design-led builds (portal-authored elements) add structure on top; treat absent sources as normal, never as errors.

## Reading compiled skills as the spec

- The bundle is composed on the platform from three tiers — ProvenMap defaults → org customizations → **app-tier overrides**. Where instructions conflict, the app tier wins.
- Distinguish **spec content** (what to build: feature specs, domain rules, API/data requirements — often in per-app skill files or `references/`) from **convention content** (how to build: style, structure, testing, naming). Both bind; specs drive the plan units, conventions drive every file you write.
- Skill files are **lock-managed by `/skills`** (`pmap-skills.lock.json`). Never edit them as part of a build — a local edit blocks future syncs of that file. If a spec is wrong, the fix belongs on the platform.
- If the skills don't pin a stack, that is a genuine decision point — ask the user once, offering what the skills' conventions imply.

## Design-to-code mapping (design-led builds)

Archetypes are server-defined, so map by what the archetype *means*, not a fixed list:

- A **node** becomes the smallest idiomatic unit that honors the repo's conventions: a service/module/package with its own entry point for service-like archetypes; schema + migration + model for data-store archetypes; a route/controller layer for gateway/API archetypes; a job/consumer for worker/queue archetypes.
- An **edge** is a dependency or data flow the code must make true — an import, a client call, a queue publish/subscribe. Realize each edge explicitly; an unrealized edge means the built app diverges from the design.
- Use the node's `description`/`detailedDescription` as its mini-spec; the element `slug` should be recognizable in the code path you create (that's what future `/analyze` runs will match — it closes the loop).
- Build order: dependencies first (data stores → core services → edges/integrations → entry points), so each unit can be verified as it lands.

## Materializing aspect snapshots

From `.provenmap/build/aspects.json` (fields mirror the platform's aspect rows; `ownerSlug` links a row to its owning board element):

- **`database.schema` tables** → migrations + ORM models honoring the row's `dialect` and `orm` fields. Emit columns exactly as specified (name, type, nullability, PK/unique, defaults, enum options); realize `foreignKeys` as real constraints and `indexes` as real indexes. **Never invent or rename columns** — the snapshot is the contract; gaps go back to the architect, not into improvisation.
- **`api.surface` endpoints** → route/controller stubs + contracts from `protocolDetails` (HTTP method + path, GraphQL operation, gRPC method), `params`, `requestBody`/`responses` shapes, and auth from `authScheme`. Wire each endpoint into the component `ownerSlug` names.
- A row with `source: "manual"` was authored by a human on the portal — it is spec in the strongest sense.

## Repo-state decisions

| State | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `empty` | No source files | Bootstrap: scaffold per skills conventions, then build every plan unit |
| `partial` | Source exists, spec has unbuilt parts | Gap-fill: touch only what the unbuilt spec requires — never refactor existing code that isn't in the delta |
| `built` | No unbuilt spec | Don't build; `/intents` for remaining work |

## Closing the loop

A build is only *done* when the board reflects it: `/analyze` → `/sync`. Skills-driven builds populate the board for the first time; design-led builds turn designed elements into mapped ones (they leave `design.unbuilt` on the next pack). Intent-backed units get server-verified when the sync matches the proposed change. This is what makes `/build` idempotent and the board a truthful map, not an aspiration.
