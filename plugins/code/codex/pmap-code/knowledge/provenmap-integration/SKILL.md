# ProvenMap Integration

## Overview

This skill provides guidance for integrating with the Claude Code Plugin API to push architecture data to ProvenMap workboards.

---

## Authentication

Store credentials in `.provenmap/config.json`:

```json
{
  "bindingToken": "YWJjMTIzLXV1aWQ6ZGVmNDU2LXV1aWQ",
  "apiSecret": "ck_cp_live_your_api_secret_here",
  "baseUrl": "https://platform.provenmap.com/api",
  "branch": "main",
  "boardSlug": "my-project-overview",
  "excludePaths": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist"
  ],
  "includeTests": false,
  "includeSourceReferences": true
}
```

`/configure` scaffolds the file with empty credentials and working defaults — the empty
fields are intentional, the user fills them in:

```json
{
  "bindingToken": "", "apiSecret": "", "boardSlug": "",
  "baseUrl": "https://platform.provenmap.com/api", "branch": "main",
  "excludePaths": ["node_modules", "dist", ".git", "coverage"],
  "includeTests": false, "includeSourceReferences": true
}
```

### Request Headers

All API requests require header-based authentication:

```
X-CodePlugin-Token: {bindingToken}
X-CodePlugin-Secret: {apiSecret}
Content-Type: application/json
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description              |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| POST   | `/code-plugin/push`       | Push nodes and edges     |
| GET    | `/code-plugin/archetypes` | Get available archetypes |
| GET    | `/code-plugin/elements`   | Get existing nodes/edges |

### Push Modes

| Mode      | Behavior                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `merge`   | Create or update by slug, keep existing |
| `replace` | Delete all existing, create new         |

See `references/api-reference.md` for complete endpoint documentation with request/response examples.

### Data Transformation

When converting from internal format to ProvenMap:

| Internal Field         | ProvenMap Field   | Notes                                                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node.id`              | `slug`               | Direct mapping                                          |
| `node.name`            | `name`               | Direct mapping                                          |
| `node.type`            | `archetypeName`      | service→Container, component→Component, external→System |
| `node.type` + children | `primitiveType`      | 'container' if has children, else 'node'                |
| `node.parent`          | `parentNodeSlug`     | Direct mapping                                          |
| `node.path`            | `sourceReferences[]` | Wrap in array                                           |
| `edge.sourceSlug`      | `sourceSlug`         | Direct mapping (pass-through)                           |
| `edge.targetSlug`      | `targetSlug`         | Direct mapping (pass-through)                           |
| `edge.type`            | `relation`           | Direct mapping                                          |
| -                      | `edge.archetypeName` | Always "Relationship"                                   |

## Sync Workflow

### Full Sync

1. **Load configuration** - Read ProvenMap credentials
2. **Load board manifest** - Read `.provenmap/boards/manifest.json`
3. **Load analysis data** - Read `.provenmap/boards/<board-slug>.json`
4. **Transform data** - Convert internal format to ProvenMap format
5. **Push data** - Single push via `/code-plugin/push` with `--board-slug`
6. **Update status** - Save sync results to board store

### Status Tracking

Sync state is stored per-board in `.provenmap/boards/stores/<board-slug>.store.json`. Changed files are detected on-demand via `git diff` against the `analyzedAtCommit` hash stored in board metadata.

## Error Handling

| Status | Meaning                         | Action                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 400    | Invalid payload/branch mismatch | Check request format              |
| 401    | Invalid credentials             | Verify bindingToken and apiSecret |
| 403    | Access denied                   | Check binding permissions         |
| 404    | Binding not found               | Verify configuration              |
| 422    | Invalid data format             | Validate node/edge structure      |

## Configuration Reference

| Field          | Required | Default                   | Description                 |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `bindingToken` | Yes      | -                         | Combined auth token from UI — base64url-encoded `workspaceId::bindingId` |
| `apiSecret`    | Yes      | -                         | API secret — `ck_cp_live_` followed by an alphanumeric string |
| `baseUrl`      | No       | https://platform.provenmap.com/api | API endpoint                |
| `branch`       | Yes      | -                         | Git branch name — must match the branch configured on the binding |
| `boardSlug`    | Yes      | -                         | Target board — `/configure` can discover and write it for you |
| `excludePaths` | No       | []                        | Paths to exclude            |
| `includeTests` | No       | false                     | Include test files          |
| `includeSourceReferences` | No | true                  | Attach source references (file paths / document anchors) to synced nodes/edges; set `false` to omit them |

`analysis.subagentModel` (optional) pins the model used for every parallel analysis
subagent in `/analyze` drill-downs; unset = per-layer defaults.

## Credential Setup and Reconfiguration

### Where the values come from

A ProvenMap source must already be created and bound to a workboard (do this in the
ProvenMap UI first if it isn't yet). Once bound, open the board's hub → the binding's
row → **Copy credentials**. The secret is shown **once** — at binding creation or after
"Regenerate secret & copy" (regenerating disconnects any other binding on the same
source until it re-copies). The dialog's `.provenmap/config.json` snippet matches the
fields in Authentication above exactly.

Credentials live in ONE place — the config file, never the chat.

### Reconfiguring an already-configured project

`/configure` offers four routes when `.provenmap/config.json` already has credentials:

- **Switch to a different board (browser)** — re-bind this project to another board
  without hand-editing credentials. This re-resolves the full credential triple
  (`bindingToken` + `apiSecret` + `boardSlug`), since a different board is a different
  binding with its own secret. The `--rebind` flag is what unlocks the board picker —
  without it, a bound project's login is authentication-only:
  1. Run `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --start --rebind --host codex --domain code --plugin-version 0.18.1` and print the JSON `display` field verbatim in your reply — the Bash output panel is collapsed for the user (the browser opens best-effort).
  2. After they sign in, pick the new board, and confirm, run `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --poll --host codex --domain code` (give the Bash call ~250s; re-run on `status: "pending"`). Print `display` verbatim.
  3. On `status: "complete"`, the config now points at the newly selected board — the `display` panel already shows it.
- **Update specific fields** — have the user edit `.provenmap/config.json`, then confirm
  and re-verify.
- **Re-run verification** against the current file.
- **Cancel** and keep the existing configuration.

## Skills Compilation

`/skills` compiles the platform's composed skill bundle — ProvenMap defaults, then your
org's customizations, then this app's own overrides — into IDE-native skill files under
the host skills directory (Claude Code: `.claude/skills/`).

### Never-clobber

A committed lock manifest (`pmap-skills.lock.json`) records the hash of every file the
command wrote. On each run: a managed file you have NOT touched is refreshed; a file you
HAVE edited is left exactly as-is and reported back. The command only manages files it
wrote — anything else in the skills directory is untouched. Commit the compiled skills
and the lock file so the whole team and every agent session share them.

### Result fields (`pmap-skills.js --sync` / `--status`)

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `note` | Ready-to-print sentence covering local edits, a foreign `CLAUDE.md`, and unsupported-host files, when any apply |
| `withheld.count` | Skill file(s) withheld because they need a newer plugin build; these are script/asset files this plugin build can't accept yet — everything else synced normally |
| `written` / `updated` / `deleted` / `unchanged` | Sync counts by outcome |
| `orphansKept[]` | Files the platform dropped but you had edited, so they were kept |
| `foreign[]` | Files that already existed at a managed path but this command never wrote — left alone |
| `localEdits[]` | Files with local edits, left untouched; reconcile by adopting the edits on the platform (app-tier override) or discarding them and re-running `/skills` |
| `inSync` (status) | `true` when disk matches the lock and the server manifest |
| `upstreamChanged` (status) | `true` when the platform's skills changed since the last sync |
| `locallyModified[]` (status) | Files you have edited (protected on the next sync) |
| `missing[]` (status) | Managed files deleted from disk (a sync restores them) |

## Branch-Mismatch Prompt

When a command's preflight check (`pmap-preflight.js`) exits 11, print its `display`
field verbatim, then ask via **AskUserQuestion**:

- Header: `Branch`
- Question: `"This project is bound to a different branch. How do you want to proceed?"`
- Options: **Re-bind to this branch (`/login`)** — run the `/login` workflow inline, then
  re-run the preflight step; **Stop — I'll switch branches myself** — stop; the
  `git switch` line is already printed in `display`. Never run `git switch` yourself: the
  working tree may be dirty.

## Examples

### Example 1: Push architecture analysis to ProvenMap

User says: "Sync my analysis to ProvenMap"

Actions:
1. Load configuration from `.provenmap/config.json`
2. Load analysis data from `.provenmap/boards/<board-slug>.json`
3. Transform nodes and edges to ProvenMap format
4. Push via `POST /code-plugin/push` with smart sync (diff-based)

Result: Architecture data synced — nodes created/updated, edges linked on the workboard

### Example 2: Configure API connection

User says: "Connect to ProvenMap"

Actions:
1. Read credentials from `.provenmap/config.json`
2. Validate by fetching archetypes from API
3. Discover root board from server
4. Write `.provenmap/config.json` with credentials

Result: Configuration saved, connection verified, ready for `/analyze` and `/sync`

## Troubleshooting

### Error: 401 Invalid credentials
**Cause:** bindingToken or apiSecret is incorrect or expired
**Solution:** Re-run `/configure` with fresh credentials from the ProvenMap UI

### Error: 400 Branch mismatch
**Cause:** The binding pins one git branch and you are on another — the server rejects pushes from any other branch
**Solution:** `git switch <pinned-branch>` to work on the branch this board maps, or `/login` to re-bind this project to a binding pinned to the branch you're on

### Error: 422 Invalid data format
**Cause:** Nodes or edges have invalid structure (missing slug, bad archetypeName)
**Solution:** Run `/analyze --clean` to regenerate analysis, then retry `/sync`
