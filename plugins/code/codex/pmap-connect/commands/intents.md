Work the intent queue for this board. An **intent** is an architect-authored work item: a proposed change to the document repo, anchored to board elements, that you implement (or reject) from this session. Resolutions flow back to the architect's board.

**This is the plugin's first write-capable command.** Every other ProvenMap command only reads the document repo and writes `.provenmap/` state; this one modifies project files to implement an intent. Never edit files before the user has picked an intent and you have claimed it, and always show the user what you changed.

**Display contract:** every `pmap-intents.js` output carries a ready-to-print markdown `display` field. Print it verbatim **in your reply** — never reformat, reorder, summarise, or rebuild its tables; the Bash output panel is collapsed for the user. Branch only on the exit code and the JSON fields named below.

## Workflow

### Step -1: Preflight — binding, branch, local state

This command touches board state, so it runs behind the preflight gate. The gate is **enforced by a
script, not by prose** — run it and react to its exit code; never decide on your own that the
project is fine.

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-preflight.js
```

Print the JSON's `display` field **verbatim** — do not reformat, reorder, or summarise it.

| exit | meaning | action |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| 0 | Proceed | Continue to the next step. If `repairs.boardsRecovered` is non-empty, local state was just restored from the server — say so once (the `display` already carries the sentence) and continue. |
| 1 | Not connected, or credentials rejected | Make the **connect-now offer**: AskUserQuestion "Connect to ProvenMap now?" → **Connect now** runs `pmap-login.js --start` then `--poll` inline (print each `display` verbatim) and resumes this command on `status: "complete"`; **Not now** stops with the `error` sentence verbatim. |
| 2 | Binding could not be verified | Print `error` verbatim and stop. Name `/status` for the full local picture. |
| 11 | Branch mismatch | Print `display` verbatim, then ask via AskUserQuestion. Header: `Branch`. Question: `"This project is bound to a different branch. How do you want to proceed?"` Options: **Re-bind to this branch (`/login`)** — run the `/login` workflow inline, then re-run this step; **Stop — I'll switch branches myself** — stop, having already printed the `git switch` line. Never run `git switch` yourself: the working tree may be dirty. |

### Step 0: Pull the intent list

Read `boardSlug` from `.provenmap/config.json`, then run:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --list --board-slug <boardSlug>
```

Print `display` verbatim, then branch:

- **Exit code 1** → print the display, then make the **connect-now offer** (see the end of this file)
- **Exit code 3** → stop; the display carries the error — for rejected credentials make the **connect-now offer** (see the end of this file)
- **`featureAvailable: false`** → stop (the display carries the feature-gate message)
- **`count: 0`** → stop after the display; there is nothing to work on

On success the intents are also persisted to `.provenmap/intents/` (one JSON file per intent) for `--show` to use. The `intents[]` array is already sorted in pick order — the display's `#` column indexes straight into it.

### Step 1: Pick an intent (browser-first)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is an intent id, use it and skip ahead to Step 2. Otherwise open the visual picker in the browser:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --select-start
```

- **`notAvailable: true`** → the server doesn't support browser selection yet; use the **terminal fallback** below.
- **Success** → print `display` verbatim (it carries the URL + code), then wait for the selection (give this Bash call ~250s):

  ```bash
  node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --select-poll --max-wait 240
  ```

  Branch on the JSON:
  - `selectStatus: "complete"` → the user picked in the browser and the intent is **already claimed** under their signed-in identity, and the output already includes the full intent payload. Print `display` verbatim, apply the Step 2 stale gate to what it shows, then continue at **Step 5** (skip claim and show — both already done).
  - `selectStatus: "pending"` → print `display` verbatim and re-run `--select-poll` (the session stays valid ~15 minutes); ask the user before giving up.
  - **Exit 2** (denied/expired) → offer to restart (`--select-start`) or use the terminal fallback.
  - **Exit 3** → print `display` verbatim and stop.

**Terminal fallback** (no browser available, or `notAvailable`): ask with AskUserQuestion — offer the top 3 intents from `intents[]` (label = name, description = its priority/status plus the summary); the "Other" option is where the user types a different # or id from the table. Then continue with Steps 2–4.

### Step 2: Gate the pick

Before claiming, check the chosen intent's summary fields:

- **`stale: true`** → do NOT implement. Tell the user: "This intent is stale — the board changed since the architect authored it, so the proposed change may no longer apply. Re-check with the architect (they can re-lock it), then pull again." Stop unless the user explicitly insists after that warning.
- **`status: in_progress`** and `assignedTo` names someone who isn't this user → warn that another developer may already be implementing it, and confirm before proceeding.

### Step 3: Claim it (single-winner — skip if claimed via the browser)

Browser selections are already claimed under the user's signed-in identity — skip this step. For the terminal path: `implemented` resolutions are only accepted for claimed intents, so claim before touching any file. Use the developer's name — ask the user, or default to `git config user.name`:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --claim <intentId> --by "<name>" --host codex --domain connect
```

Print `display` verbatim, then branch on `claim.reason`:

- `claimed` → proceed
- `already_in_progress` → ask the user whether to continue anyway (e.g. it's their own earlier session) or pick another intent
- `not_claimable` / `not_found` → re-run `--list` and re-present (Step 1)
- **Exit code 3 with `notAvailable: true`** → stop; do not implement unrecorded work

### Step 4: Show the full intent and map it to source (skip if `--select-poll` already showed it)

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --show <intentId>
```

Print `display` verbatim — it carries the description (the why), directive, proposed board changes, anchor→file map with architect notes, and downloaded attachments. Then:

- **Read every attachment with a local path** (`.provenmap/intents/attachments/<intentId>/`) — including images/PDFs; they are part of the spec. A `downloadError` means continue with the directive alone and tell the user.
- If the display lists **Linked inspections**, read each linked `manifest.json` and the selection screenshots it references — locally captured visual context (what the user pointed at in the running app) that carries into the gap review and implementation.
- For `board_diff` payloads, the JSON `intent.payload.suggestions[]` rows are the machine-readable spec (add/remove/modify nodes, edges, or aspects to make true in the document repo); a suggestion's `rationale` may end with "— Architect: …", a per-change note that is part of the spec.
- **Aspect anchors** (`elementType: "aspect"`, e.g. a database table or an API endpoint) resolve to no local files yet — the anchor `slug` IS the aspect's identity (a table name or `METHOD /path`), so locate it in the codebase by that identity. A `remove` aspect suggestion means deleting that table/endpoint; the architect's board shows it as staged until your push confirms it.
- Unresolved anchors (`resolved: false`) → locate the document repo by the element's slug/name; if there's no local board data at all, suggest running `/sync` first.

### Step 4.5: Gap review (mandatory before any edit)

**Never start editing without this step.** Load the `intent-gap-review` skill and follow it to compare the **architect's intent** (anchors, directive, `board_diff` suggestions, attachments) against **code reality** (what the anchor files actually contain now). Produce the gap table the skill specifies and classify the result:

- **`clean`** or **`minor`** (anchors resolve, the directive is locatable, suggestions apply — nits only) → say so briefly and continue to Step 5.
- **`blocking`** (the skill's criteria — e.g. anchor files/elements gone, intent `stale`, the directive references components that don't exist, a `board_diff` suggestion is inapplicable, an attachment contradicts the code, or most anchors are unresolved) → do NOT edit. Show the user the gap table, then ask with AskUserQuestion:
  - **Send back to architect** (recommended) — the gaps are the architect's to resolve. Draft a one-line reason + expected→found bullets (≤1800 chars) per the skill, show it to the user for approval, then bounce it back:

    ```bash
    node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --clarify <intentId> --note "<approved gap summary>" --by "<name>" --host codex --domain connect
    ```

    Print `display` verbatim. On success the intent leaves your queue (local copy dropped); tell the user to re-run `/intents` later once the architect has revised and re-opened it. **Stop here** — do not implement.
  - **Continue anyway** — the user judges the gap surmountable; proceed to Step 5, noting the risk.
  - **Reject** — the change is wrong for the document repo; go to Step 8 (rejected).

**`--clarify` exit codes:** 1 = missing note/config (a note is required — it's the only thing the architect receives); 2 = intent not found on the server; 3 = API error or `notAvailable: true` (server can't record it — tell the user their **decision was NOT recorded**).

### Step 5: Implement the change

Use your own tools (Read, Glob, Grep, Edit, Write, Bash) to make the change in the project:

1. Start from the anchor `files[]`; read the surrounding code to understand the current shape
2. Follow `intent.directive` as the spec. For `board_diff` payloads, realize each suggestion in code (e.g. an `add` node suggestion means introducing that component; a `remove` edge suggestion means severing that dependency)
3. Respect the project's conventions — match existing style, keep the change scoped to the intent
4. If while implementing you discover the change is inapplicable (already done, contradicts the actual code, or would break something) → stop and go to Step 8 (reject / resolve_other) instead of forcing it

### Step 6: Verify and record the evidence

**Mandatory before any `implemented` resolution:** the CLI refuses `--resolve --kind implemented` without fresh recorded evidence. The evidence is what *you* record — the server does not re-run your checks — so run the checks for real and record their true exit codes. Recording a check you didn't run, or a passing exit code for a failing check, defeats the whole loop.

1. Discover what the project uses: `package.json` scripts (`test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`), `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, CI config — whatever this project verifies with
2. Run the relevant checks (at minimum the type/compile check and the tests nearest the changed code)
3. **Record each check you ran**, honest exit code included:

   ```bash
   node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --record-verify <intentId> \
     --command "<the check command>" --exit-code <its exit code> --summary "<one line>"
   ```

   Print `display` verbatim. Re-recording the same command replaces its earlier entry, so record a failure, fix, re-run, and re-record.
4. **Show the user the verify results** — pass or fail, with the actual output summarized

If verification fails, fix and re-verify, or tell the user honestly that it doesn't pass. Evidence expires after ~30 minutes — resolve while it's fresh.

### Step 7: Resolve as implemented (only after user confirms)

Show the user the diff summary and verify results, and ask whether to record the resolution. If they committed the change, include the commit SHA (and PR URL if any):

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --resolve <intentId> --kind implemented \
  --note "<one-line summary of what was changed>" \
  --commit-sha <sha> --pr-url <url> --by "<name>" --host codex --domain connect
```

(`--commit-sha` / `--pr-url` are optional — omit them if there's no commit yet.)

Print `display` verbatim — it explains how the loop closes (proven on a later `/sync`; local state cleaned up).

- **Exit code 1 with `verifyRequired: true`** → evidence is missing, stale, or failing — go back to Step 6.

### Step 8: Rejecting or resolving another way

If the user declines the intent, or it's inapplicable:

- **Rejected** (the user disagrees with the change, or it's wrong for the document repo):

  ```bash
  node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --resolve <intentId> --kind rejected \
    --note "<why — the architect reads this>" --by "<name>" --host codex --domain connect
  ```

- **Resolved other** (moot: already implemented, superseded, fixed elsewhere):

  ```bash
  node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-intents.js --resolve <intentId> --kind resolved_other \
    --note "<what actually resolved it>" --by "<name>" --host codex --domain connect
  ```

A `--note` is effectively required for both — it's the only feedback the architect gets. Ask the user for the reason if it isn't clear from the conversation. Print `display` verbatim.

### Resolution exit codes

- **Exit 0** → recorded; the display reports it
- **Exit 1 with `verifyRequired: true`** → (implemented only) record verify evidence first — Step 6
- **Exit 2** → intent not found on the server (deleted/unlocked) — re-run `--list`
- **Exit 3** → not resolvable from its current status (e.g. `implemented` without a claim — claim first), API error, or `notAvailable: true` (server can't record resolutions — tell the user their decision was NOT recorded)

## Hard rules

- **Never auto-resolve.** Every resolution — implemented, rejected, resolved_other — happens only after the user has seen the outcome (diff + verify results, or the rejection reason) and said yes.
- **Never implement a stale intent** without the explicit warning + user override in Step 2.
- **No gap review, no edits.** Always run Step 4.5 before touching a file; a `blocking` gap goes to the user, never silently forced through.
- **Never `--clarify` without a user-approved note.** The bounce-back note is the only thing the architect receives — draft it, show it, get a yes, then send.
- **Claim before implementing**; the server refuses `implemented` on unclaimed intents.
- **No verify, no `implemented`.** The CLI refuses `--resolve --kind implemented` without fresh passing `--record-verify` evidence. That evidence is self-recorded — run the checks for real and record honest exit codes; never record a check you didn't run. If no checks exist in the project, record the closest honest signal (e.g. a build) and tell the user.

## Connect-now offer

Used whenever ProvenMap is not configured or the credentials were rejected (`errorType: "auth_invalid"`). Ask with **AskUserQuestion** — "Connect to ProvenMap now?" (**Connect now** / **Not now**):

- **Connect now** → run the browser login here, printing each JSON `display` verbatim **in your reply** (the Bash output panel is collapsed for the user): `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --start`, then `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-login.js --poll --host codex --domain connect` (generous Bash timeout, e.g. 250s). On `status: "complete"`, resume this command from the step that failed; anything else — stop, the display explains.
- **Not now** → stop with the canonical message: "ProvenMap not configured — run `/login` (browser) or `/configure` (manual) first" (or, when credentials were rejected: "Your ProvenMap credentials were rejected — run `/login` to reconnect").
