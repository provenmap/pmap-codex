# Insight Skill Execution Protocol

This document describes the step-by-step process for executing a server-defined InsightSkill.

## Overview

An InsightSkill is a server-defined analysis task. The server provides the instructions and references; the plugin executes them using Claude as the analysis engine. The existing architecture board provides the context.

The output is an `InsightDraft[]` — a flat array of findings. There is no wrapping container, no scope dictionary, no separate paths or suggestions arrays. Each finding carries its own `trail` (the traversal through the graph) and optionally a `proposal` (a structural change). Board and node slugs in trails are the canonical values from the pack — never invented mnemonics.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Fetch Skill List (Precis)

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-insights.js --list-insight-skills
```

Parse the JSON output:

- `featureAvailable === false` → report "Insights not available for this account" and stop
- `skills === []` → report "No insight skills configured" and stop
- Otherwise, use the `skills[]` precis data (slug, name, description, category, duration) for skill selection

The precis list is used in two ways, decided by the command argument:

- **Agent-inferred mode** (a natural-language prompt): semantically match the prompt to the `skills[]` precis — slug, name, description, and category — and select one or more skills. Explain the choice to the user, one sentence per skill (e.g. "Running **security-analysis** — matches your request to check for vulnerabilities"). Store the full prompt as `{{userPrompt}}`. If no skills clearly match, list the available skills and ask the user to clarify or pick.
- **User-selection mode** (`--select` or no arguments): display the skills table —

  | Slug | Name | Category | Duration | Description |
  | ---- | ---- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | ...  | ...  | ...      | ...      | ...         |

  — then ask the user both questions together: _"Which skill(s) would you like to run? Also describe your analysis focus (e.g., 'check auth service for security issues') — a focus prompt is required."_ Do **not** proceed until the user provides both a skill selection and a focus prompt; store the focus prompt as `{{userPrompt}}`.

The remaining arguments select skills directly:

| Argument       | Behaviour                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--list`       | Print the skills table and stop — no execution               |
| `--all`        | Run all available skills; `{{userPrompt}}` is empty          |
| `<skill-slug>` | Run only the named skill directly; `{{userPrompt}}` is empty |

### 1b. Fetch Full Skill

Once a skill is selected, fetch its full content (instructions + references):

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-insights.js --get-insight-skill <slug>
```

Parse the JSON output:

- On success, the `skill` field contains the full skill with `instructions` and `references[]`
- Exit code 3 with 404 → skill not found, skip it
- If `skill.instructions` is null → skip and report "Insight skill '<slug>' has no instructions"

For `--all`, fetch each skill's full data one at a time before executing it.

### 2. Extract Board Context

The `boardSlug` in `.provenmap/config.json` is the **primary board**, but an insight may target any layer board — `.provenmap/boards/manifest.json` (when it exists) lists them, and the prepass below resolves the rest.

**Preferred:** run the context prepass once and read the pack:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-insights.js --build-context --board-slug <boardSlug> --out .provenmap/insights/<boardSlug>.context.json --summary --domain connect
```

The summary prints to stdout; read the **full pack** from `.provenmap/insights/<boardSlug>.context.json`. This canonical path is also what `--save-insight` loads as the oracle for its quality gates — so if you switch the primary board later, rebuild the pack for that board too. It resolves the board universe (insights mode: root + child subtree + siblings; demo mode `--demo`: start board + direct children only) and emits the skill variables, the keyed element index, the edge adjacency, and a degree table — so you don't read every board JSON or generate scope keys and board aliases by hand, which is the main source of scope-validation failures on push.

- **Exit 0** → use the pack for the context variables (step 4), the scope (step 7), and the payload paths (step 9).
- **Exit 1/2 or any error** → fall back to the manual walk below and generate keys/aliases by hand.
- **Skip when trivial:** for a single board under ~30 nodes with no manifest/child boards, reading that one board JSON directly is simpler — skip the prepass.

Pack shape: `boards[]` (`{slug, alias, layer, parentBoardSlug, context:{techStacks,languages,archetypes}, nodeCount, edgeCount}`), `scopeBoards[]` (legacy scope helper — unused in v2; use `boards[].slug` and `elements[].slug` directly for trail stops), `elements[]` (`{key, board, slug, type, name, description, kind?}` — `slug` is the canonical node slug to use in trail stops; `kind: "port"` marks a boundary port, a hand-off to the parent board's node that is **never a trail stop** — cross with `via: { kind: "layer", direction: "ascend" }` to the node named after `port--`, on the board's `parentBoardSlug`), `edges[]` (`{board, slug, sourceKey, targetKey, type, description, weight, class}` — `slug` is what a trail's `via.edge` carries, verbatim; `weight` is the import count behind a rollup edge, or null for a model-authored one — rank dependency strength by it; `class` is `primary` (drawn) or `reserve:hub` / `reserve:budget` (a kept fact the canvas hides until focus — real coupling, walk it freely)), `degree[]` (`{key, board, fanIn, fanOut}`, ranked by **combined** fan-in+fan-out, most-connected first; ports have no row), `primaryBoardDefault`, `stats` (`{boardCount, elementCount, edgeCount, droppedEdges, duplicateSlugs, unresolved[]}`). A non-zero `droppedEdges` means some board edges had unresolved endpoints and were omitted — don't assume two nodes are unconnected solely because no `pack.edges` row links them.

Fallback — read the board's analysis data from `.provenmap/boards/<boardSlug>.json` and extract skill variables — see [graph-context.md](graph-context.md) for details. Also read `.provenmap/boards/manifest.json` (if it exists) to discover child/layer boards. For nodes that have a `layerBoardSlug`, read that child board's data file too to enable cross-board analysis. Also read any sibling boards discovered from the manifest to enable cross-domain paths.

- `{{boardSlug}}` — the root board slug from config (used as default primary board)
- `{{primaryBoardSlug}}` — the board slug to use as the top-level primary for this insight (defaults to `{{boardSlug}}`, see Primary Board Selection below)
- `{{techStacks}}` — from `metadata.techStacks`
- `{{detectedLanguages}}` — from `metadata.languages`
- `{{nodeArchetypes}}` — unique archetype names (node `type` field) from nodes
- `{{focusNodes}}` — node slugs with their archetypes and descriptions

#### Primary Board Selection

Determine `{{primaryBoardSlug}}` — the board to use as the top-level primary for this insight:

1. **Default** — `pack.primaryBoardDefault` (the board the pack was built for); without a pack, the root board from config (`{{boardSlug}}`)
2. **User prompt match** — if `{{userPrompt}}` names a domain or component that matches a board in `pack.boards` (fallback: the manifest), use that board
3. **Skill scope** — if the skill's instructions explicitly target a specific layer or domain, use the matching board
4. **Finding concentration** — if during analysis the majority of findings relate to elements on a single child board, switch to it

Pick only from `pack.boards`: the board you choose must **not** appear in `pack.stats.unresolved` (a board the pack couldn't load). Store the result as `{{primaryBoardSlug}}` — this goes in the top-level `boardSlug` of the push command. Trail stops on sibling/child boards reference those boards by their canonical slug directly.

### 3. Read Skill Instructions

The skill's `instructions` field contains the primary analysis task. This is the "skill body" — Claude follows it verbatim.

If the skill has no `instructions` (null), skip it and report "Insight skill '<slug>' has no instructions".

### 4. Interpolate Skill Variables

Replace `{{variable}}` placeholders in the instructions with values from the board context (step 2) and the user's prompt.

**From the pack:** source `{{techStacks}}`, `{{detectedLanguages}}` and `{{nodeArchetypes}}` from the `.context` of the `pack.boards[]` entry whose `slug` equals `{{primaryBoardSlug}}`, and format `{{focusNodes}}` from that board's `pack.elements` rows (slug, type, description). The `metadata.*` sources in the table below are the fallback walk:

| Variable                | Source                                                    | Example Value                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `{{boardSlug}}`         | `metadata.boardSlug`                                      | `my-app-overview`                         |
| `{{techStacks}}`        | `metadata.techStacks` joined by `, `                      | `react, node, postgres`                   |
| `{{detectedLanguages}}` | `metadata.languages` joined by `, `                       | `typescript`                              |
| `{{nodeArchetypes}}`    | Unique `type` values from `nodes[]`                       | `Service, Database, Queue`                |
| `{{focusNodes}}`        | Formatted node list                                       | `- auth-service (Service): Handles login` |
| `{{userPrompt}}`        | User-provided focus prompt (empty string if not provided) | `check the auth service for OWASP risks`  |

After replacing all `{{variable}}` placeholders, if `{{userPrompt}}` is non-empty, append the following section at the end of the instructions:

```
## User Analysis Focus
{{userPrompt}}
```

Use this focus to prioritise findings, narrow scope, or highlight areas the user explicitly cares about. Omit this section if `{{userPrompt}}` is empty.

### 5. Execute Analysis

Follow the interpolated instructions. Typically this involves:

- Reading source files via Read/Glob/Grep tools
- Scanning for patterns described in the instructions
- Consulting references when the instructions say "see `<reference-name>`"

### 6. Consult References On Demand

When instructions reference a named document (e.g., "see `owasp-patterns`"), find the matching entry in the skill's `references[]` array by `name` and read its `content`.

References are named markdown documents that provide detailed detection patterns, classification rules, or domain knowledge the analysis needs.

### 7. Plan trail stops for each finding

Before writing InsightDraft objects, identify the board and node slugs for each finding's trail. Trails use canonical slugs directly — no scope dictionary, no element keys, no board aliases.

**From the pack:**

- Board slugs: `pack.boards[].slug` — use the exact string, e.g. `"my-project-overview"`.
- Node slugs: `pack.elements[].slug` — use the exact string, e.g. `"auth-service"`.
- Edge slugs: `pack.edges[].slug` — copy verbatim (server format `<source>--<relation>--<target>`); never derive one.

**Rules:**

- Every trail must have exactly one entry stop (no `from`).
- All subsequent stops set `from` to the `id` of the stop they follow.
- `via` is required when `from` is set; forbidden on the entry stop.
- Two stops with the same `from` create a branch — label them with `branchLabel`.
- A component found in source that has no `pack.elements` row becomes a `proposed: true` stop on the trail, plus a `proposal` field on the InsightDraft.
- Board-level finding (no specific node): one stop with `board` set and `node` omitted.

### 8. Produce InsightDraft objects

For each finding, create an `InsightDraft` with a trail grounded on pack slugs:

```json
{
  "name": "Hardcoded JWT Secret",
  "insight": "JWT secret is a string literal in src/auth/login.ts:42; rotation requires code changes.",
  "polarity": "risk",
  "priority": "critical",
  "confidence": "verified",
  "impact": "Source-code access reveals the signing key, enabling token forgery.",
  "tags": ["security", "secrets"],
  "advice": {
    "kind": "recommendation",
    "text": "Read the secret from JWT_SECRET environment variable; rotate via deployment.",
    "effort": "small"
  },
  "trail": [
    { "id": "s1", "board": "my-project-overview", "node": "auth-service" }
  ]
}
```

Field guide:

- **`name`** — short label (≤ 100 chars), imperative.
- **`insight`** — evidence-driven description (5–500 chars). State _what_ you found and _why_ it matters. Opinions live in `advice.text`.
- **`polarity`** — one of `risk`, `strength`, `opportunity`, `observation`.
- **`priority`** — one of `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`.
- **`confidence`** — one of `verified` (read the code), `likely` (strong evidence), `inferred` (derived from patterns), `speculative` (pattern-match guess). Be honest; the renderer surfaces this.
- **`impact`** — optional. Consequence if unaddressed (risk/opportunity) or gained by leveraging (strength). Max 300 chars.
- **`measurement`** — optional. Attach quantitative data to any polarity: `{ value, unit, baseline?, threshold?, trend? }`.
- **`tags`** — free-text classification keywords (max 10).
- **`advice`** — one object: `{ kind: "recommendation", text, effort }` when there is a concrete action; `{ kind: "context", text }` for background only. Never both. `effort` (`trivial`|`small`|`medium`|`large`|`epic`) is required for recommendations, omitted for context.
- **`trail`** — minimum 1 stop. See [report-output-format.md](report-output-format.md#trail) for the full Stop schema.
- **`proposal`** — optional. Set when the finding proposes a structural board change. See [report-output-format.md](report-output-format.md#proposal).

#### Multi-stop trail example

When a finding traces a flow (blast radius, dependency cascade, auth path), use multiple stops:

```json
{
  "name": "Auth endpoint p99 latency",
  "insight": "Auth endpoint p99 latency is 850ms at peak, dominated by bcrypt comparison.",
  "polarity": "observation",
  "priority": "medium",
  "confidence": "likely",
  "measurement": { "value": 850, "unit": "ms", "baseline": 200, "threshold": 500, "trend": "increasing" },
  "advice": {
    "kind": "context",
    "text": "Bcrypt cost factor is 14, set in 2019; modern hardware supports 12 without weakening security."
  },
  "trail": [
    { "id": "s1", "board": "my-project-overview", "node": "api-gateway", "note": "Entry — rate limited" },
    { "id": "s2", "from": "s1", "via": { "kind": "edge", "edge": "api-gateway--calls--auth-service" }, "board": "my-project-overview", "node": "auth-service", "note": "850ms p99" },
    { "id": "s3", "from": "s2", "via": { "kind": "edge", "edge": "auth-service--calls--user-db" }, "board": "my-project-overview", "node": "user-db", "note": "Read per request" }
  ]
}
```

Ground every consecutive stop pair against `pack.edges`. Two stops with the same `from` express a branch (fan-out). A stop on a different board uses `via: { kind: "layer", direction: "descend" }` or `via: { kind: "jump" }` for unrelated hops.

### 9. Structural proposals

There is no separate `GraphSuggestion` step. When the analysis identifies a structural improvement (add a node, remove an edge, modify a container), set `proposal` on the InsightDraft whose trail names the affected elements. A `proposed: true` stop marks a node that doesn't exist yet.

```json
{
  "name": "Add Redis cache layer",
  "insight": "auth-service queries user-db on every request; no caching layer exists.",
  "polarity": "opportunity",
  "priority": "high",
  "confidence": "verified",
  "advice": { "kind": "recommendation", "text": "Introduce Redis; cache sessions with 15-min TTL.", "effort": "medium" },
  "trail": [
    { "id": "s1", "board": "my-project-overview", "node": "auth-service" },
    { "id": "s2", "from": "s1", "via": { "kind": "proposedEdge" }, "board": "my-project-overview", "node": "redis-cache", "proposed": true, "parent": "infra-container" }
  ],
  "proposal": { "action": "add", "targetType": "node", "changes": [{ "field": "name", "before": null, "after": "Redis Cache" }] }
}
```

See [report-output-format.md](report-output-format.md#proposal) for the full Proposal schema.

### 10. Assemble and Save

Build the `PushInsightsCommand` JSON. The `insights` field is a flat `InsightDraft[]` — no wrapper object, no scope, no paths, no suggestions:

```json
{
  "boardSlug": "<primaryBoardSlug>",
  "insightSkillSlug": "<skill.slug>",
  "insights": [
    {
      "name": "Hardcoded JWT Secret",
      "insight": "JWT secret is a string literal in src/auth/login.ts:42.",
      "polarity": "risk",
      "priority": "critical",
      "confidence": "verified",
      "advice": { "kind": "recommendation", "text": "Read JWT_SECRET from env; rotate via deployment.", "effort": "small" },
      "trail": [
        { "id": "s1", "board": "my-project-overview", "node": "auth-service" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tags": ["risk:security-review", "area:auth"],
  "info": "<one-line audit summary of what this analysis surfaced, ≤350 chars>"
}
```

Before assembling, pull the org's ContextTag vocabulary so you tag with names the org actually uses:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-context-tags.js
```

Notes:

- **`insights`** — `InsightDraft[]`. Every trail stop's `board` must be a slug from `pack.boards[].slug`; every `node` must be from `pack.elements[].slug`. The CLI validates this.
- **`tags`** — curated ContextTag names classifying the **whole** insight (risk area, domain, lifecycle). Copy names **verbatim** from `pmap-context-tags.js` output (`tagNames`); the server **drops** any name not in the vocabulary. Optional — omit or use `[]` when none fit. Distinct from the per-finding `tags` inside each InsightDraft, which are free-text keywords.
- `info` is a short (≤ 350 char) human-readable line describing **what this run surfaced** — e.g. `"3 auth risks incl. a hardcoded JWT secret; missing rate-limit on the payment path"`. Be specific; if omitted, the CLI falls back to a generic label.

Write the payload to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp/insight-<slug>.json`). **First ensure the pack exists for `{{primaryBoardSlug}}`** — if you switched the primary board, rebuild it now (`--build-context --board-slug <primaryBoardSlug> --out .provenmap/insights/<primaryBoardSlug>.context.json`). Then save with `--require-pack`:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pmap-insights.js --save-insight /tmp/insight-<slug>.json --board-slug <primaryBoardSlug> --require-pack --push --host claude --domain code
```

The CLI runs validation gates before writing/pushing:

1. Zod schema (structural validity).
2. Trail validation: every stop's `board` resolves in the pack; every `node` resolves on that board; `via` is present iff `from` is set; exactly one entry stop; no duplicate `id`s within a trail; `proposed: true` stops name a `node`.
3. Grounding against the context pack (when present): every stop's `board` and `node` exist in the pack, and every `via.edge` is a real `pack.edges[].slug` that joins the two stops (HARD — the server rejects the push otherwise; only a board with `droppedEdges` downgrades a missing edge to a warning). `/demo-insights` additionally requires at least one trail of 3+ connected stops.

Two channels: **`validationErrors[]` + exit 3** is blocking — fix the listed fields and retry (errors carry a JSON path, the bad value, and the fix; copy any "did you mean" pack row verbatim). **`warnings[]` + exit 0** is non-blocking and already saved — review once and improve if cheap, but **do not loop** on warnings.

### 11. Report Result

- If pushed successfully: "Pushed to server (batchId: abc-123, N insights)". The result's `insights[]` lists the created rows in send order — keep it when proposing intents from these findings in the same session; nothing can recover that mapping later.
- If push not available: "Saved locally — server push not yet available"
- If push failed: "Saved locally — push failed: <error>"
